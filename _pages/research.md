       <br>  <br>
      We examine the impact of competition from better connectivity to domestic markets on formal and informal firms. Combining geolocalized information on road improvements under a large infrastructure investment programme with data on manufacturing firms in Ethiopia between 2001 and 2013, we show that an increase in competition is associated with higher labour productivity, capital-intensity, investment in physical capital and wages in the formal sector. On the contrary, there is no associated increase in labour productivity or wages in the informal sector. In fact, increased competition results in lower capital-intensity and investment, a shift in composition towards workers without primary education and a lower likelihood of operating in the informal sector. We thus highlight that the benefits of infrastructure improvement programmes may not accrue uniformly in the economy.

       <br>  <br>
      This paper examines the impact of ethnic favoritism on the allocation of transportation infrastructure in Ethiopia. Analyzing road investments and ethnic composition in 5 KmÂ² grid cells, the study finds that areas predominantly inhabited by the ruling ethnic elite receive 6.8% more road investments and see a 7.5% improvement in pavement quality. Investigating the staggered implementation of the Road Sector Development Program from 1997 to 2016, I explore how road construction influences local economic activity. Nighttime light intensity, indicating higher economic activity, increases by two thirds of a standard deviation in cells benefiting from new roads, with earlier investments yielding higher effects. Notably, economic benefits are more pronounced in areas where the population shares the ethnicity of the ruling elite.

      Martorano, B., Perra, E., and Tiberti, M., (2023) "Spatial inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa using night-time lights data",  <i> MERIT Working Papers 2023-032, United Nations University. </i> 
      <br>  <br>
      In this paper, we study the evolution of spatial inequality during the recent COVID-19 pandemic in  Africa and assess if there is any association between the outbreak of the health crisis, the strictness of policy restrictions and the changes observed in spatial inequality. Using remotely sensed night time lights data, we find that spatial inequality decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Yet, there are huge differences within and between countries. Spatial inequality decreased in Southern and Northern African countries while it increased in Central African countries}. Spatial inequality mainly decreased in countries implementing more stringent measures but also in those areas that were richer before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
