I'm a Postdoctoral research in Development Economics at the University of Turin Cognetti de Martiis, Italy. I am an affiliated researcher at [UNU-MERIT university](https://www.merit.unu.edu/about-us/profile/?staff_id=4612) and at [EMANES netowork for Economic studies](https://emnes.org/about-us/fellows/). I received my PhD in Development Economics in July 2022 from the Doctoral programme jointly offered by the Universities of Trento and Florence. 

I’m passionate about . Since Data Engineering is at the intersection of both Data Science and Software Engineering - both fields that I love - I decided to concentrate in Data Engineering.

I have strong programming skills in **Python** and currently learning **AWS, Spark, Hadoop and MapReduce**. I have solid understanding of Machine Learning and Databases (**Oracle, MongoDB, Redis**). My previous school [projects](/portfolio) also involved Node.js, Bootstrap, Java, C++.

Before enrolling to my Master’s program, I got a PhD in Political Science and worked as a Managing Editor for online analytical journal. During my previous career in academia, I developed strong [analytical, communication and management skills](/achievements/). I also have completed a number of [Data Science specializations online](/certificates).

I am the person who takes initiative and stays curious.
