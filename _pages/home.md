I'm a Postdoctoral researcher in Development Economics at the Department of Economics and Statistics Cognetti de Martiis at the University of Turin, Italy. I am an affiliated researcher at [UNU-MERIT university](https://www.merit.unu.edu/about-us/profile/?staff_id=4612) and at [EMANES network for Economic studies](https://emnes.org/about-us/fellows/). I received my PhD in Development Economics in July 2022 from the Doctoral programme jointly offered by the Universities of Trento and Florence. 

I am passionate about Development Economics and Economic Geography. Throughout my PhD and recent research positions, I have focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with a particular emphasis on the impact of infrastructural investments on firms' productivity in Ethiopia. I am also interested in the intersection of environmental and development economics, exploring how environmental degradation influences structural transformation and the adaptive strategies of local communities. My work integrates advanced geospatial and remote sensing techniques to address key challenges in sustainable development.

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore my research and ongoing projects. If you like to connect [contact me](mailto: elena.perra@unito.it).
